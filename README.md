## Setting
Kujari Stabilisation Part 3 (Action Hunting Dark) is the third installation of a story-driven campaign for Arma 3 where players play as 2008 era ADF personnel in the small Sub-Saharan African country of Kujari. This mission focuses on providing security to a NGO Aid station, and checkpoint operations

Kujari is a small African country in Sub-Saharan Africa that has recently been overrun and terrorised by the Kujari National Liberation Front (KNFA). Violence including attrocities by the KNFA have reached an unprecedented level in the recent weeks, resulting in massacres bordering on the level of genocide on the local populace. Persons from a recent massacre have been displaced to an aid station in a small village and is in desperate need of supplies and security; which is to be provided by the ADF in a "blue hat" operation. After this task is completed, the callsign is designated to checkpoint operations North of the FOB to check the identification cards of persons passing through.

## Background
Kujari Statbilisation was designed to give a fresh persepective of ADF operations in the 2007 period to the FoddSquad. This was done through community modifications to give a somewhat realistic and period accurate representation of ADF equipment.

This operation includes aid station security, checkpoint operations, and the search and destroy of an enemy cache.

This installation of Kujari Stabilisation is based on, and focuses heavily on the real life events of the Kibeho massacre of Rwanda on the 22nd of April 1995. It is intended to be a respectful and educational insight to real world attrocities experienced by ADF personnel and in no way is meant to make light of the real wolrd event.
